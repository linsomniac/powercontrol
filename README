A program to control the CPS International AC Power Controller under
Linux and other "termios"-type Unix systems.  Allows the status to
be checked, power to be turned on, turned off, cycled (off then on)
and allows for dealing with the watchdog.

COMMENTS
   The terminal line used can be changed by modifing the "modemLine"
   setting at the top of the "powercontrol" file, or by using the
   "-l" or "--line" command-line option.

EXAMPLE USAGE

   To read what the status of the device is, run:

      python powercontrol status

   To reboot the device attached:

      python powercontrol reboot

   To specify what device file to use as /dev/ttyS1:

      python powercontrol -l /dev/ttyS1 status

GETTING STARTED
   Usage:
      usage: powercontrol [<arguments>] <command> [...]

         [ -l | --line <file> ]     Serial line device file name.
         [ -v | --version  ]        Display program version.
         [ -h | -? | --help  ]      Display this usage message.

      status      -- Display status (results are parsable by /bin/sh)

ABOUT CPS IPC HARDWARE

   The "IPC" is a device which can be controlled by an RS-232 port or
   by a ringing telephone (no DTMF, just based on reaching a number of
   rings threshold).  Based on this input it can turn the power to a
   device on or off.  Nice, cheap unit.  http://www.cpscom.com/

   Note that this was developed without cooperation of CPS, and
   that you should not call them seeking support for it.
